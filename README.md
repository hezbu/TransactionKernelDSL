# TransactionKernelDSL
Transaction Framework + DSL + Transforming Tool for .NET 2.0 onwards

This solution is comprised by a Framework, some financial protocol parsers, and DSL project (MDD). 

The goal of this solution is to foster and ease devlopment of financial authorizers and switches, by reusing software artifacts, and
by automating code transformation from a domain-specific language to code, scripts and other diagrams.

By now, it works in Visual Studio 2012, and is supported .NET framework 2.0 onwards.
